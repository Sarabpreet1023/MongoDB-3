This project demonstrates how to design and implement a flexible e-commerce product catalog using MongoDB. It leverages a nested document structure to efficiently store product variations (like different colors, sizes, and stock levels) within a single product document. This approach simplifies queries, improves read performance, and ensures data for a single product is stored together.

The examples provided are written for the MongoDB Shell (mongosh).
